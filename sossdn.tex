% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.1 April 2013
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.

% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide

\begin{abstract}

% background
A wide variety of ICSes connected to the physical world rely on
the underlying network to monitor and control critical physical processes.
Compromising communication network in ICSes will cause damaging impact on
the healthy operation of critical national infrastructures related to power,
water, gas and so on.
% one sentence summary of 3 works: ConVenus, Self-healing, DSSnet
In this work, we tackle various challenges to the protection of ICSes by
applying SDN technologies and developing innovative security applications and tools.
In particular, we install \textit{ConVenus} between the control plane and data plane
to enforce the correct policies defined in the network layer;
on the data plane layer, we enhance the resilience of PMU networks against cyber attacks
with \textit{SelfHealer}[open to suggestions];
we build a hybrid testing platform \textit{DSSnet} to support
high-fidelity analysis of cyber attacks on SDN powered ICSes networks.
To be more specific:

\begin{itemize}
% ConVenus
        \item \textbf{ConVenus}: With SDN-enabled global visibility, ConVenus
        1) inherits the real-time verification functionality from Veriflow\cite{Veriflow};
        2) adopts the dynamic data-driven paradigm to preserve congestion-free 
	property throughout the lifetime of the delay-critical part of the ICSes network.
	When each time there is a network flow to be inserted, updated or removed,
        ConVenus performs the following steps:
        \begin{enumerate}
                \item identifies the minimum subnetwork that is affected by the incoming flow update
                \item models the extracted subnetwork with an undirected graph as the network topology
        and a set of directed path as the network flows
                \item runs a fast simulation algorithm to quickly compute the throughput of every flow
        in the network model and report congestion if it exists.
        \end{enumerate}
        By incrementally updating the model and
	rejecting the updates that causes congestion, ConVenus can guarantee that at any time the network
	is congestion-free.  

% Self-healing PMU network
\item \textbf{SelfHealer} utilizes the feature of direct programmability offered by SDN to
        achieve resilience against cyber attacks in power grid.
        To firstly prevent further propagation of the attack, SelfHealer directly
        programs the SDN-enabled network switches so that compromised Phasor Measurement Units
        and Phasor Data Concentrators are isolated.
        Meanwhile, the disconnected yet uncompromised PMUs will be automatically
        reconnect to the network and thus self-heal the observability of the power system.
        The self-healing process is formulated as integer linear program model to
        minimize the overhead of the self-healing process,
        while considering the constraints of power system observability,
        hardware resources, and network topology.

% DSSnet and virtual time
\item \textbf{DSSnet}\cite{DSSnet} address the challenge that it is infeasible to create
        a physical testbed for modern ICSes given its large scope.
        We combine a power distribution system simulator with an SDN network emulator
        so that high performance and temporal fidelity are preserved without sacrificing
        the supported scalability.
        The combination is built on the foundation of a virtual time system:
        on one hand, virtual time system tightly controls (pauses and resumes)
        the execution of the emulation system whenever synchronization between two
        sub-systems required;
        on the other hand, by accurately dilating the clock of emulated network ends,
        DSSnet is able to emulate high bandwidth and low latency networks that exceeds
        resource capability available on the test machines.
\end{itemize}
