% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.

\begin{abstract}

% background
The research goal of this proposal is to build a more secure, resilient and safe network environment for the industrial control systems (ICSes) that operate many national critical infrastructures.
Modern ICSes increasingly rely on the computer and communication networks to efficiently monitor and control critical physical processes.
Compromising those networks can impact the successful operations of the critical infrastructures, including power grids, oil and gas distribution systems, waster water treatment, etc.
%A wide variety of ICSes connected to the physical world rely on underlying networks to monitor and control critical physical processes.
%Compromising a communication network in ICSes can cause serious damage to the healthy operation of critical national infrastructures such as power, water, transportation and so on.
% one sentence summary of 3 works: ConVenus, Self-healing, DSSnet
In this work, we apply the emerging SDN technology to secure ICSes in the context of smart grids, and investigate several innovative SDN-aware security applications.
SDN paradigm decouples and logically centralizes the control functionality from the data forwarding functionality in an ICS communication network.
Within the SDN-enabled smart grid, we install \textit{ConVenus} between the control plane and the data plane to enforce the correct network-layer invariants.
On the data plane layer, we enhance the resilience of PMU networks against cyber attacks with \textit{SelfHealer}.
We build a hybrid testing platform \textit{DSSnet} to support high-fidelity analysis of cyber-attacks on SDN-enabled ICSes.
Specifically,
\begin{itemize}
% ConVenus
        \item \textbf{ConVenus}: With global network visibility offered by SDN, ConVenus inherits the real-time verification functionality from Veriflow\cite{Veriflow} and contains new models and methodology to preserve the congestion-free property in time- and mission- critical ICS networks.
        ConVenus performs the following actions to verify network congestion for each flow update received from the controller:
        \begin{enumerate}
                \item Identify the minimum subnetwork that is affected by the incoming flow update.
                \item Create a network graph model consisting of the affected flows and ports.
                \item Compute the throughput of every flow in the network graph model using a four-phase simulation model and verify flow congestion.
        \end{enumerate}
        %By incrementally updating the model and rejecting the updates
        %that causes congestion, ConVenus can guarantee that at anytime
        %the network is congestion-free. 

% Self-healing PMU network
\item \textbf{SelfHealer} utilizes the feature of direct
        programmability offered by SDN to
        achieve resilience against cyber-attacks in the power grid.
        Firstly, to prevent further propagation of the attacks,
        SelfHealer directly programs the SDN-enabled network switches
        such that compromised Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and 
        Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs) are isolated.
        Meanwhile, the disconnected yet uncompromised PMUs will
        automatically reconnect to the network and thus
        self-heal, regaining observability of the power system.
        The self-healing process is formulated as integer linear program
        model which minimizes the overhead of the self-healing process,
        while considering the constraints of power system observability,
        hardware resources, and network topology.

% DSSnet and virtual time
\item \textbf{DSSnet}\cite{DSSnet} combines electric power distribution system simulation with SDN network emulation to offer an unique platform for testing and evaluating the SDN-aware applications for ICS resilience and security. 
        The integration is built on the foundation of a virtual time system.
        On one hand, the virtual time system tightly controls the execution of the emulation system
        and provides a basis for correct and efficient synchronization between the simulation and emulation systems.
        On the other hand, by accurately dilating the clock of the emulated entities,
        DSSnet is able to significantly improve the fidelity and scalability of the network emulation system.
